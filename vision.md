# VISION
Encourage children to program so that they can participate in an online game/s.

* Tamagotchi element: (pet that belongs to them). They have to maintain their
  pets.
* Pets have personality
* Players can customize their pets to reflect their personality
* Robot wars element: Competitive, game element
* Community element: Interact with other players through their pets.
  Notifications based on players actions (e.g. updating code)

## 3 Main elements
* Social
* Gaming/Competitive
* Pet (something you've made, has your personality)


# Mechanics of a game
## Noughts and Crosses case study
* As a programmer I want to enter a bot that i've programmed into a game of tic
  tac toe against another programmer's bot so that we can see whose is superior
  in it's programming.
* As a programmer when the game is over, I want to have my ranking in the bot
  league table recalculated so that I know how my bot compares to other peoples.
* As a programmer I want to challenge an opponent to a game of tic tac toe so
  that both of our bots can be entered into a new game.
* As a programmer I want to join a queue to play a game of tic tac toe so that I
  can see if any other programmers are waiting for my challenge.


# System architecture
* Web app
* python
* Open source

# Skeleton project as a web service
* Set up github
* Code is deployed onto heroku
* Continuous integration (on heroku)
* Simple build script that runs a single unit test and deploys if successful
* Check out acceptance test things. Results should be remotely accessible and
  triggerable and should be easily understood. (Fitnesse/RSpec like) 
* Customer should be able to read and write acceptance tests

# Agile project management tool
* User stories
* Burn down charts
* Progress/Status (scheduling, what's been started, what's been finished, is it ready
  for testing, has it been deployed) 
* Remote access
