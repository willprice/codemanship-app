|Query:employees hired before|1980-12-10|
|employee number|first name|last name|hire date|
|1429           |Bob       |Martin   |1975-10-10|
|9924           |Bill      |Mitchell |1966-12-19|

This test will fail: Bob Martin's hire date is wrong, Bill Mitchell
will be marked as missing, and James Grenning will be marked as surplus.
